<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>
Here are the details of the information we collect when you use the Trailence website or mobile application:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Personal and contact information:</b>
    When you choose to create an account on Trailence, we collect your email address and password.<br/>
    By default, your account is set to "Anonymous" for any public activity.
    You can later change this setting on your preferences page, choosing to appear with a name or remain anonymous.
    When you update this setting, all your past public activities will be displayed according to the new configuration.<br/>
    When you use the contact page, your email address is recorded so we can respond to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Trails:</b>
    When you are logged into your Trailence account, we collect the trails you record via the web or mobile app.<br/>
    Each trail may include the following information: title, date of the track, duration, location, type of activity, elevation gain, description, and waypoints.
    You are free to edit this information within the web or mobile app.<br/>
    In addition to this, the recorded GPS trace may include the following data for each point: geographic location, date and time of the recorded position, altitude, speed,
    direction, and estimated accuracy of the location and altitude.<br/>
    A trail may also include photos. Each photo may contain the following information: description, geographic location where the photo was taken, and the date and time it was taken.
    When you add a photo, the description is automatically filled with the file name. If the file is in JPEG format and contains GPS metadata, that data is saved.
    If the file contains a photo date, that date is saved; otherwise, if the file name contains a date, that date is saved.
    You are free to edit the description and geographic location of each photo.<br/>
    All of this data remains private and cannot be viewed by other users unless you explicitly share the track with someone using the sharing feature,
    or unless you request to publish your trail and it has been approved by our moderators.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Published tracks:</b>
    When you request to publish one of your trails and our moderators approve the publication, a public copy of your trail is created.
    Your private trail remains private, and any changes or deletion you make to it are not reflected in the public version.<br/>
    You may request changes to a public trail. These changes will be reflected on the public version after approval by our moderators.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ratings and comments:</b>
    When viewing a public trail while logged in, you can leave a rating and/or a comment. You can also reply to a comment.
    These reviews and responses become publicly visible immediately.<br/>
    You can delete a comment or reply that you have previously posted.<br/>
    You can also update your rating, but you cannot delete it.<br/>
    All comments and replies may be reviewed by our moderators, who have the authority to remove them if deemed inappropriate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Following a public trail:</b>
    When you follow a trail that you found among Trailence's public trails, a note indicating that you followed the trail, along with the date, will be added to the public trail.
    If your account is configured to display a public name, that name will be shown.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Trail sharing:</b>
    When you share trails with one or more other users, those users will be able to see your email address associated with the share,
    as well as all the information related to the shared trails.
    They will not be able to modify any of this information. You can later modify or remove a share.<br/>
    When another user shares a trail with you, you have the option to remove yourself from that share.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Location:</b>
    The website or mobile app accesses your GPS location upon request in the following two cases:
    when you record a track, and when you use the location tool on a map.<br/>
    When you first view a map, we may also request the location of your IP address via the service https://freeipapi.com,
    in order to display the map around your approximate location. This information is not stored.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Automatically collected data:</b>
    When you use the website or mobile app, we may log your IP address in a technical log.<br/>
    At each login, we record the app version, browser, and operating system of your device.
    You can view this information on your account page under "Connected Devices." When a device is removed,
    its information may be retained for up to 500 days.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Purposes of Data Processing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>To provide our services:</b>
    We store your login information and data to allow you to access them across your different devices or after logging out.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Communication:</b>
    We may use your email address to contact you in the following cases:
    when you request a password change or account deletion,
    when another user shares a trail with you,
    or to respond to a message you sent through our contact page.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Content moderation:</b>
    We review content published on Trailence to ensure quality and compliance with our rules.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
  Trailence does not use any tracking or advertising cookies.
  Only the login token used to identify the user on our servers is stored.
</p>

<h2>Sharing and Use of Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
Trailence does not share any data with third parties, except in the case of a formal request from law enforcement or a court.<br/>
</p>

<p>
We use the following service providers, which may access information from your device. Their respective privacy policies can be consulted on their websites:
<ul>
  <li><b>Map tiles:</b>
    We use the following map tile services:
    OpenStreetMap (https://tile.openstreetmap.org), OpenTopoMap (https://tile.opentopomap.org), IGN (https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/).<br/>
    The application fetches map images directly from your device, without going through our servers.
  </li>
  <li><b>Overpass API:</b>
    We use Overpass API (https://overpass-api.de) to retrieve OpenStreetMap path data.<br/>
    The application fetches the data directly from your device, without going through our servers.
  </li>
  <li><b>Cloudflare:</b>
    We use Cloudflare's Turnstile product when we need to verify that access to a feature is not being performed by a bot:
    when a wrong password has been entered on your account,
    when a user accesses the contact page and has recently sent multiple messages or is not logged in,
    during a password reset request,
    and when creating a new account.
  </li>
  <li><b>freeipapi:</b>
    When you first open a map, in order to display a relevant view, we use the service https://free.freeipapi.com/api/json to obtain your IP-based location.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Data Retention Period</h2>

<p>
  Content that you have explicitly made public on Trailence (published trails and their content, comments, reviews) is retained indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
  Your non-public content is retained until you delete your account.
</p>

<h2>Right to Correction, Deletion, and Portability of Your Data</h2>

<p>
  If your Trailence account data or your content is incorrect, you can modify it using the tools available on the website or mobile app.
</p>
<p>
  You can request the deletion of your account by logging in and visiting your account page.
</p>
<p>
  At any time, you can export your trails and photos in GPX/ZIP format, allowing you to transfer them to another application that supports GPX files.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
  Data is hosted on a server with a security level appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
  Site administrators may access this data as part of their normal duties.
</p>
<p>
  The password you choose is encrypted before being stored in our databases.
  This means that, barring significant computing power and under current best practices,
  it is impossible for us or any third party to recover your password.
  However, it is your responsibility to change it regularly, avoid reusing it across multiple platforms,
  and not share it with others to ensure its integrity.
</p>

<h2>Acceptance</h2>

<p>
  By using our website and mobile application, you agree to all the provisions of this privacy policy
  and consent to Trailence collecting and processing your data in accordance with this policy.
</p>
